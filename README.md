## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL or any other supported database (configured in the Prisma schema).
- There should be a `.env` file in the project root folder, with `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET` defined. I used [render](https://render.com/) to set up a free PostgreSQL db.

## Configuration

1. Update the `.env` file with your database connection details and other environment variables.
2.  ```
     DATABASE_URL="postgres://xxxxxxxxx"  
     JWT_SECRET = "2RXuR@xxxxxxxx"
    ```

## Database Setup

1. Run database migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`

## Usage

Start the server: `npm run dev`

The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
